# Expect CLI (Headless Mode)

Expect is an AI-powered browser testing tool that tests your code changes in a real browser. This skill covers using expect via CLI commands — no interactive TUI required.

## When to Use

Use expect from the command line when:

- Running browser tests from an AI agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, etc.)
- Automating tests in CI/CD pipelines
- Scripting browser test runs in non-interactive environments
- Piping expect output to other tools

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @expect/cli
```

## Headless Detection

Expect automatically runs in headless (non-TUI) mode when:

- Running inside an AI agent (detected via `CI`, `CLAUDECODE`, `CURSOR_AGENT`, `CODEX_CI`, `OPENCODE`, `AMP_HOME`, or `AMI` environment variables)
- `stdin` is not a TTY (e.g., piped input, CI runners)

No special flags needed — expect detects the environment and skips the TUI.

## Commands

### Test unstaged changes (default)

```bash
expect
```

When run headless with no subcommand, expect auto-detects the best scope:

- If there are unstaged changes → tests those
- If on a feature branch with commits → tests the branch diff
- If on main with no changes → exits

Equivalent explicit command:

```bash
expect unstaged
```

### Test entire branch diff

```bash
expect branch
```

Compares the current branch against `main` (or the detected main branch) and tests all changes.

### Test a specific commit

```bash
expect commit <hash>
```

Tests the changes introduced by a specific commit. The hash can be a full SHA or short hash.

```bash
expect commit abc1234
```

## Options

| Flag                          | Description                                        |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `-m, --message <instruction>` | Natural language instruction for the browser agent |
| `-f, --flow <slug>`           | Reuse a previously saved flow by its slug          |
| `-y, --yes`                   | Skip plan review and auto-run after planning       |
| `--base-url <url>`            | Override the browser base URL                      |
| `--headed`                    | Run browser in headed (visible) mode               |
| `--cookies`                   | Enable cookie sync from your browser               |
| `--no-cookies`                | Disable cookie sync                                |
| `-v, --version`               | Print version                                      |

## Environment Variables

| Variable                  | Description                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `EXPECT_BASE_URL` | Default base URL for the browser (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`) |
| `EXPECT_HEADED`   | `true`/`1` to run headed by default                              |
| `EXPECT_COOKIES`  | `true`/`1` to enable cookie sync by default                      |

CLI flags override environment variables when both are set.

## Common Patterns

### Quick test with a message

```bash
expect -m "Click the login button and verify the form appears" -y
```

The `-m` flag provides the instruction. The `-y` flag skips plan review so it runs immediately.

### Test with a specific base URL

```bash
expect --base-url http://localhost:5173 -m "Add an item to the cart and check the total updates"
```

### Reuse a saved flow

```bash
expect -f login-flow
```

Saved flows are created in the TUI and stored locally. Reuse them by slug with `-f`.

### Test branch changes end-to-end

```bash
expect branch -m "Verify the new settings page renders correctly" -y
```

### Test a commit in headed mode

```bash
expect commit abc1234 --headed -m "Check the modal animation" -y
```

### Agent-oriented one-liner

```bash
EXPECT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 expect -m "Test the signup flow end-to-end" -y
```

## Output Format

In headless mode, expect streams structured output to stdout:

```
Starting <plan title>
→ step-1 <step title>
  ✓ step-1 <summary>
→ step-2 <step title>
  ✓ step-2 <summary>
Run passed: <summary>
```

Failed assertions appear as:

```
  ✗ step-3 <failure message>
Run failed: <summary>
```

Browser interaction logs appear indented:

```
    browser:click Clicked "Submit" button
    browser:fill Typed "user@example.com" into email field
```

## Exit Codes

- `0` — all tests passed
- `1` — test failure or error

## Tips

- Always pass `-y` when running from an agent to skip the interactive plan review step.
- Always set `EXPECT_BASE_URL` or `--base-url` so expect knows where your app is running.
- Use `-m` to give expect a clear, specific instruction about what to test.
- Combine subcommands with options: `expect branch -m "..." -y --base-url http://localhost:3000`.
- If a flow is reusable across runs, save it in the TUI and invoke it with `-f <slug>` for consistency.
